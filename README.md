# Reader

## Codecademy Project

Reader is creating an AngularJS app for their e-reader service. Here’s what it looks like.

- The app displays a list of books on the home page.
- When you click on a book, it takes you to the book’s description.
- When you click the Read button, it takes you to the book’s first chapter. From there, you can use the Forward and Back buttons to read the book.
